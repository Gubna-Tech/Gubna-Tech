# My Philosophy: Embracing the Spirit of Warez and FOSS Movements

In a world driven by monetary gains and proprietary systems, I find solace in aligning my philosophy with the spirit of the Warez (software piracy) and FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) movements. For me, coding is not merely a means of making a living or a service for hire; it is a deeply personal endeavor that must resonate with my own passions and interests.

I firmly believe that technology should be harnessed to automate and simplify our lives. It has the power to empower individuals, enhance efficiency, and enable us to reach new heights of progress. However, I also hold the conviction that the concept of intellectual copyright, as it stands in our society, is fundamentally flawed.

To me, intellectual copyright often feels like a deceptive construct, limiting the potential of creativity and hindering the free flow of knowledge. It restricts the accessibility of valuable creations, stifling innovation and impeding the collective advancement of society.

In essence, my philosophy encourages a radical departure from traditional notions of intellectual property. I firmly advocate for the liberation of artistic and technological works, urging creators to break free from the confines of paywalls and embrace a more open approach.

If you truly love the art you create, I believe it should be shared with the world without restrictions. Don't allow your creations to remain locked away, hidden behind a paywall. Instead, share them freely and generously, allowing others to benefit, learn, and build upon your work. By doing so, you foster a collaborative environment where ideas flourish, fueling the fires of innovation and pushing the boundaries of what is possible.

So, if you seek my involvement in a project or desire my contributions, it is crucial that the endeavor resonates with my personal interests and passions. I am not motivated by financial gain, but rather by the intrinsic value and alignment with my beliefs. Only in this way can I dedicate my full energy, enthusiasm, and expertise to a cause that I wholeheartedly support.

In addition to my stance on technology and intellectual property, I also draw inspiration from the wise words of Kurt Vonnegut, who beautifully encapsulated a sentiment I deeply resonate with. Like Vonnegut, I wholeheartedly believe in embracing kindness as a guiding principle in our interactions with others.

To quote Vonnegut, "Hello babies. Welcome to Earth. It's hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It's round and wet and crowded. On the outside, babies, you've got a hundred years here. There's only one rule that I know of, babies - God damn it, you've got to be kind."

For me, this quote serves as a reminder to treat everyone as equals, irrespective of their backgrounds, beliefs, or ideologies. I reject the notion of subscribing to cults or engaging in exclusive societies. Instead, I firmly believe that organized religions, while being inclusive communities, can bear similarities to cults, raising suspicions about their motives and practices.

By embodying kindness, we foster an environment of empathy, compassion, and understanding. It is through these qualities that we can bridge divides, dismantle barriers, and cultivate a society that celebrates the inherent worth and dignity of every individual.
